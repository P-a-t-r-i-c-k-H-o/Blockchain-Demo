# Blockchain-Demo

For this project , I used blockchain concepts in order to create a voting system that ensures the safety of the data stored in the election. The idea behind is that a series of votes are stored in a block that is immutable. In a blockchain, if you change the contents of the block, it also changes the hash that is the encryption of that block. That hash of the previous block is stored in the content of the current block, therefore, changing a single block in the chain can compromise the entire system. 

In the file labeled blockchain, it provides the structure of the blockchain and the methods necessary for the system. I used mainly this [tutorial]([url](https://medium.com/coinmonks/python-tutorial-build-a-blockchain-713c706f6531)) I found online to learn about the basics of coding a blockchain. I was coding this mainly on pycharm after my VScode somehow stopped working.
